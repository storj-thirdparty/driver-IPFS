## Config Files

There are two config files that contain Storj network and IPFS connection information. The tool is designed so you can specify a config file as part of your tooling/workflow.

##### `ipfs_property.json`

Inside the `./config` directory there is a `ipfs_property.json` file, with following information about your IPFS instance:

* hostName 	:- Host Name connect to IPFS
* port	   	:- Port Number connect to IPFS
* path	   	:- Path of file to be uploaded
* chunkSize	:- Size of chunks to be created for uploading

##### `storj_config.json`

Inside the `./config` directory a `storj_config.json` file, with Storj network configuration information in JSON format:

* key - This is a storj ipfs private key used to encrypt data being uploaded to Storj.
* apiKey - API Key created in Storj Satellite GUI (mandatory)
* satelliteURL - Storj Satellite URL (mandatory)
* encryptionPassphrase - Storj Encryption Passphrase (mandatory)
* bucketName - Name of the bucket to upload data into (mandatory)
* uploadPath - Path on Storj Bucket to store data (optional) or "" or "/" (mandatory)
* serializedAccess - Serialized access shared while uploading data used to access bucket without API Key (mandatory)
* allowDownload - Set *true* to create serialized access with restricted download (mandatory while using *share* flag)
* allowUpload - Set *true* to create serialized access with restricted upload (mandatory while using *share* flag)
* allowList - Set *true* to create serialized access with restricted list access
* allowDelete - Set *true* to create serialized access with restricted delete
* notBefore - Set time that is always before *notAfter*
* notAfter - Set time that is always after *notBefore*

##### `storj_download.json`

Inside the `./config` directory there is a `storj_download.json` file, with following information about your file to be downloaded:

* hash 			:- Hash of file to be download
* downloadPath	:- Port Number connect to IPFS
* key 			:- This is the same storj ipfs private key used to decrypt data uploaded to Storj earlier.


## Run

The following flags  can be used with the `store` command:

* `accesskey` - Connects to Storj network using instead of Serialized Access Key instead of API key, satellite url and encryption passphrase.
* `shared` - Generates a restricted shareable serialized access with the restrictions specified in the Storj configuration file.

The following flags  can be used with the `download` command:

* `accesskey` - Connects to Storj network using instead of Serialized Access Key instead of API key, satellite url and encryption passphrase.

Once you have built the project run the following commands:

##### Get help

```
$ ./driver-IPFS --help
```

##### Check version

```
$ ./driver-IPFS --version
```

##### Connect to IPFS and upload the files using their corresponding hash to Storj

```
$ ./driver-IPFS store --ipfs <path_to_ipfs_config_file> --storj <path_to_storj_config_file>
```

##### Connect to IPFS and upload the files using their corresponding hash to Storj bucket using Access Key

```
$ ./driver-IPFS store --accesskey
```

##### Connect to IPFS and upload the files using their corresponding hash to Storj and generate a Shareable Access Key based on restrictions in `storj_config.json`

```
$ ./driver-IPFS store --share
```

##### Connect to IPFS and download the files using their corresponding hash from Storj

```
$ ./driver-IPFS download --ipfs <path_to_ipfs_config_file> --storj <path_to_storj_config_file> --storjDown <path_to_storj_download_config_file>
```

##### Connect to IPFS and download the files using their corresponding hash from Storj bucket using Access Key

```
$ ./driver-IPFS download --accesskey
```
